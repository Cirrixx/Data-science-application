# Data-science-application
A small selection of the projects I have completed to improve my ability to use Python. 
Projects were selected to be included in the portfolio to demonstrate my ability to use different concepts in Python, rather than based on technical prowess (e.g. the Blackjack game is fairly simplistic because I made it when first learning about object-orientating programming)
